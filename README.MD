# Google Cloud Certifications Notes
I'm interested on taking on GCP certifications so I will be keeping the notes here.

Each MD represents notes for that particular certificate.

# Google Cloud Certification Categories
 1. **Fundamental**
	- [Cloud Gigital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-digital-leader)
		- This certification gives you knowledge of cloud concepts and the products, services, tools, features, benefits, and use cases of Google Cloud. You don't have to be technical.

 2. **Associate** 
	- [Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer)
		- This certification validates you on the fundamental skills to deploy and maintain cloud projects.

	
 3. **Professional**
	- This certifications is about specific advanced role. It goes deeper than the associate certificate. It validates key technical job functions and advanced skills in design,implementation and management of GCP. There are multiple roles on this certifications including:
		1. Cloud Architect
		2. Cloud Data Engineer
		3. Cloud Developer 
		4. Cloud DevOps Engineer
		5. Cloud Security Engineer
		6. Cloud Network Engineer 
		7. Google Workspace Engineer
		8. Machine Learning Engineer


> Most of the certification does test you stuffs that are not related to google, so you will have to have a general knowledge of the industry and best practices.
>
> I believe each of the certifacates have only 3 years of life, after that you will have to renew before it expire.
